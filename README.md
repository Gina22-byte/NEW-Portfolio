<h1>Project 1  - Personal Portfolio</h1>

<p>This project required the creation of a personal portfolio website offering appealing design, with the flexibility of being easily added to over time.

<p>All links on the website lead to the correct sections of the webpages and the social icons lead to appropriate external websites, including my GitHub page. The site is also suitable for viewing from a range of devices. This was acheived by utilising Chrome Dev Tools responsive toggling and the appropriate implementation of media queries.</p>

<p>Colour scheme was chosen with a view to being interesting whilst still being easy on the eye. Usage of whitespace allowed for clear visual distinction between sections, resulting in enhanced user experience.</P>

I chose a pleasant sans-serif font to increase user experience and accessibility.

<h3>Acknowledgements:</h3>

<p>I would like to express gratitude to the resources listed below which enabled me to overcome certain challenges.</P>


- I chose the landing page colour scheme from here:
https://cssgradient.io/

- I chose a white icon from the site below - deliberately choosing a png version to allow for a transparent background:
https://icons8.com/

- I used this helpful resource for centering my 'About Me' text inside button: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/32188383/centering-text-within-a-button

- I referred to this guidance for adding 'icons' to the hero main: https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/HTML/Multimedia_and_embedding/Adding_vector_graphics_to_the_Web

- I used this resource for aligning my 'project-cards': https://www.educative.io/answers/how-to-align-items-to-the-center-using-flexbox

- I created my contact form thanks to this YouTube tutorial: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UAWhbMDBGW4
However, the form would not flag 'required' on empty input fields, despite my adding 'required' at the end of each HTML code line (which was not included in the tutorial). The solution to this was that the button type required changing from 'button' to 'submit'. I sourced the solution from this outstanding website: https://www.w3schools.com/tags/att_input_required.asp

- I referred to this resource for styling and personalising the contact form: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/8083430/how-to-change-the-font-and-font-size-of-an-html-input-tag

<P>I would like to give a huge shout out to FORMSUBMIT who I discovered offer a free back-end email delivery service on HTML forms. They even provide you with the relevant code to set this up. Whilst I did not use their HTML contact form for the final draft of this project, I did test the service and can confirm that it works flawlessly:
